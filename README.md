<hr>
motoXchange is an imaginary non-profitable  website. This website is used like a platform of buying, selling or exchanging userâ€™s new, used or reconditioned cars. It is mentioned that this platform is completely free for users. Customers can selects cars according to their wishes and communicate with the user who have posted them.

In this project I have used HTML,CSS as frontend, PHP as backend and to add some functionality, JavaScript and JQuery have been used. This project is database-oriented where I have used PHP MyAdmin, MySQL for this handling database.
As a portable web application written primarily in PHP, it has become one of the most popular MySQL administration tools, especially for web hosting services. The project includes SQL insert, select, delete operations. PHP has worked behind the picture. It has two different functionalities for admin and users. I have used Session to track the user name and save username and password for easy login at later using Cookies.
